      [FLUSHLEFT]Dear ${ ll_name or "[BLANK]"},
      
      I am writing regarding my ${ "rental application for" if 'criminal' in dv_accommodation_request else "tenancy at"} ${ full_address }.
      The Violence Against Women Act and 2022 reauthorizations (“VAWA”) prohibit covered housing providers from denying housing or evicting a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, or stalking simply because they are victims. Covered housing providers include public housing, project-based Section 8, tenant-based Section 8 (voucher-holders), USDA Rural Development, and Low-Income Housing Tax Credit properties. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued guidance on VAWA housing protections for survivors (see PIH-2017-08, [https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/PIH-2017-08VAWRA2013.PDF](https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/PIH-2017-08VAWRA2013.PDF))
      
	    The facts of my situation are as follows: ${ why_needed or "[BLANK]"}
      
      I therefore request that ${ dv_accommodation_request or "[BLANK]"}
      
      If you require documentation to certify that I am a survivor of domestic violence or sexual assault, please provide that request to me in writing. Please ensure that all correspondence and documentation related to this matter are kept strictly confidential. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 
      
      Sincerely,
